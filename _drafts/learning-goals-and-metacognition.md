I'm making my list of goals for the next year, as one does. I won't write them
here because I don't like feeling like I'm preemptively bragging about things
I'll do this year, but lots of them involve learning or developing new skills.

## Ye Olde Goals

0. more air horns
0. write a blog post about haskell to casually inform everyone you are learning
   haskell
0. develop the power of flight
0. increase bench press from 1 million pounds to 2 million pounds
0. save the president from ninjas (again ugh)

This suggests a meta-goal to get better at learning. I realized I don't really
know anything about learning besides "study real good", so to start out I read
a review of the literature (say with a British accent, like lit-trah-chu) on
learning. Here are some things I learned about learning by reading
[Self-Regulated Learning: Beliefs, Techniques and Illusions](paper link here).

## Our brains are weird and gorgeous

My model for brains and memory was like a crappy hard drive: there is some space
in your head, and when you learn stuff you shove that knowledge in to your
head in a specific spot, filling up that space. When you remember stuff you
pull it out of this storage space and impress everyone at the party with your
scintillating analysis of Kim Jong Un's physiognomy that you actually pulled from
that Vice.com article.

This is untrue. Your brain is way cooler than a computer. It is more like
planting a new plant in a forest than storing something on a hard drive.
The more actively you work to learn something (testing yourself, teaching
others, summarizing information, asking questions, making mistakes, etc),
the better-rooted the plant will be, and the more likely you are to actually
learn something and remember it later.

Like the surrounding environment affects the health of a plant, what you
already know and believe affects how easily you learn new information. With a
computer, a write to persistent storage either succeeds or fails, or you are
building distributed systems and have surpassed the bounds of human
understanding. With your brain, having more information to create connections
to what you are learning makes that information stick better.

A mindblowing consequence of this that our capacity to learn appears infinite.
There is no such thing as "running out of space". In fact, learning appears to
**increase** the ease of learning new information by providing more possible
connections for your to-be-formed memories.

Brains are rad. Your brain is rad.

## Learning happens from action

In college I spent many hours sitting in lectures or poring over textbooks. It
turns out that passively recieving information is the worst way to learn
something.


## Errors increase learning

## We are real real bad at judging how well we have learned things

## Programming and learning
