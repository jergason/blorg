I'm an engineering leader. I've worked at startups and giant megacorps on scalable infrastructure and user-facing products. I love supporting people and building teams and systems that help software engineers do their best work.

I like family and programming and [React Rally](https://reactrally.com) and [Soft Skills Engineering](https://softskills.audio) and 🏋️ and 🏂 and computing and business the Dunning-Kreuger effect.
I used to be on [JavaScript Jabber](https://jsjabber.com).

I tweet at [@jamison_dance](https://twitter.com/jamison_dance) and GitHub at [jergason](https://github.com/jergason).
