I am a software engineer at i.TV. I enjoy kittens, making computers smarter and
the magic of children's laughter. I tweet at
[@jergason](https://twitter.com/jergason), and GitHub at
[jergason](https://github.com/jergason). I also co-host the
[JavaScript Jabber](http://javascriptjabber.com) podcast.
