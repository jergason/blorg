title: Running A Tech Conference
description: ""

Together with [Matt Zabriskie](https://twitter.com/mzabriskie), I run [React Rally](http://reactrally.com), a community tech conference in Salt Lake City. It happened at the end of August and I've been reflecting on the experience ever since.

This was our second year doing React Rally which means I have a baseline to
compare it to. The first year everything was new and hard and scary, but the
second year the things that were actually hard and scary stuck out more.

I'm not an expert at events or community, but I've done this enough to have
something to say about what it is like to run a tech conference and what we try
to do at React Rally. Some of this is for organizers, and some is just for
people who want to peek behind the curtain. It is all obviously my opinion, and
you are free to disagree, ignore, mock, etc.

## Treat Speakers Well

Treat your speakers well. It is basically impossible to err on the side of
splurging too much on your speakers. Speakers are the lifeblood of a conference.
They put in dozens to hundreds of hours of labor to prepare talks. Most go
through stressful travel, leaving home and family to attend and speak. Almost
all of them, no matter how famous or experienced, get miserably nervous before a
talk. Make them glad they accepted and glad they spoke.

Show speakers you appreciate their efforts, and do everything in your power to
make their lives easier. Here is a partial list of things we did to treat our
speakers well. We will do more next year.


* Pay for travel and hotel. To me this is table stakes for running a
conference. Speakers spend huge amounts of time preparing, and usually miss
work to come speak. They are indirectly paying already due to opportunity
cost.

    This could be an entire blog post by itself, but if you don't pay for
    speaker travel that means only people who can afford to pay their own way
    can speak, which limits the size and diversity of your potential speaker
    pool to people who are selling things (product or consulting pitches),
    wealthy, or work for large established tech companies with travel budgets.
    These are all fine groups, but they aren't the only people with interesting
    things to say. If your budget can't cover speaker travel, you should
    consider whether you have priced your conference effectively. International
    conferences in particular should plan early for speaker travel, since costs
    can be higher.


* Have a nice speaker dinner. Our speaker dinner was at [The
 Rest](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/travel/restaurant-review-the-rest-in-salt-lake-city.html),
a local speakeasy that you get to by going through the secret bathroom
entrance from inside a fairly normal looking bar. Part of running
a conference is showing off your city or location. Find somewhere people will
be excited to go. Every city has cool unique things. Show them off, and let
your speakers have time to meet each other in a relaxed and chill atmosphere.

    Be sensitive to prep and travel plans. Some speakers may still be working
    on their talk, and might be too stressed out to go hang out with people.
    Others might not be able to come early enough for the dinner.

* Give speakers a personalized gift. We went with some moleskine journals with
the speaker's name and a conference logo embossed on the front. I've seen
lots of amazing speaker gifts on Twitter, and we will keep playing with
this next year. The specific gift isn't as important as the feeling the
speaker should get from it: that you care about them individually, and you
are so glad they came to speak. Hopefully it is something they will
actually use, so they get that good feeling regularly.

* Pay your speakers. This is the other side of the coin to paying for
speaker travel. Speakers make the conference. They help sell tickets, and
if they give a good talk it reflects well on them *and* the conference.
Paying for travel covers some of the costs of speaking, but not all of
them. Paying speakers is an attempt to cover all the other miscellaneous
costs and also pay them something for their time.

    It wasn't a huge amount (only $200), but the principle of paying
    people for their labor is important to us. We plan on increasing the
    amount we give to speakers next year.

* Make speakers comfortable. We gave speakers their
own intro music in an attempt to make them feel amazing while walking on stage.
There were some technical hiccups, so this didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped,
but when [James Kyle](https://twitter.com/thejameskyle) stepped out to his
[Linkin Park/Smashmouth
mashup](https://soundcloud.com/nonplayablerecords/this-shouldnt-work-why-does-it-work)
it was all worth it.

## Audience and Speaker Interaction

One theme of React Rally is that the people and the unstructured time
between talks are just as important as the talks themselves.

We don't have Q & A after talks. Something about being handed a microphone and
an audience after someone else gives a talk makes it easy to ask terrible
questions. If you've been to many tech conferences you've probably seen
a  question that boils down to "Hey, do you know how smart I am?" or "Hey did
you know you are totally wrong about everything you just said?"

Part of our **Treat Speakers Well** mantra is making sure they feel
respected. Letting them choose how they interact with the
attendees instead of being forced in to a potentially nerve-wracking live
defense of their ideas up on stage in front of the whole audience fits in with
that.

We have tons of downtime throughout the day. We encourage speakers, if
they choose, to talk to attendees during that time. It is a much more
relaxed experience for both parties. The speaker gets to decide if they
want to participate, and the attendee gets close interaction with an
expert in the field. At React Rally 2015 my team at
[Kuali](https://kuali.co) had a chance to chat directly with
[Jeff](https://twitter.com/lbljeffmo) of the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/)
team on some tricky issues we were facing. It was *so* helpful, and we
didn't have to grill him in front of an audience of hundreds about things
only we cared about.

## Recognize the Hallway Track

I'll say it again. We have TONS of breaks and downtime. We did two hours
for lunch, and another hour and a half for breaks during the day. We also
had an hour and a half of breakfast before the conference started. This is
not because we are lazy (although maybe we are kinda lazy). It is because
we value unstructured time just as much as structured talk time. 

The traditional name for this is the hallway track. Usually it means you
skip talks to hang out in the hallway and talk to all the interesting
people you meet at the conference. We didn't want people to have to choose
between the talks and speakers we are so excited about, and talking to old
and new friends. That is why we put so much emphasis on break time.

We used food trucks for breakfast, which means people are hanging out in
line waiting for their food, chatting. We used a food truck for coffee,
which has the same effect. Instead of catering lunch, we gave each
attendee a gift card and two hours and sent them to local restaurants. We
wanted attendees go out for lunch with a group of people and chat over food of
their choice.

**SECRET INSIDER CONFERENCE TIP:** Catered food is incredibly
expensive. It is not uncommon to pay $50 a plate for a basic, passable but
not delicious lunch. It is often the largest single expense at
conferences. Lunch gift cards and food trucks were way cheaper and way
more delicious than catering.

During the breaks we had food and snacks, but we also added a few random
activities (giant Jenga, chalk artists, etc). These weren't just to be
quirky and fun and join the conference perk arms race. The purpose of the
breaks is to bring people together and start conversations. I have been to
lots of conferences where I didn't know many people, and so I just stood
around awkwardly during the breaks having flashbacks to uncomfortable high
school experiences.

![Chalk artists drawing the React Rally and Egghead.io

Rally and Egghead.io logos")

At React Rally we want the breaks to have some kind of activity that will
break the ice with people and make it easier for them to start talking,
even if it is just "Wow, check out how cool that chalk drawing is!"

## Single Track

React Rally is unabashedly a single track conference. This is a deliberate
choice that we feel is better for the attendees and speakers.

At a multitrack conference
attendees can end up watching a completely different
conference than their peers. No one goes to the same subset of
talks. Multitrack conferences also produce <span style="cursor:help;"
title="fear of missing out">FOMO</span> -; what if the talk you're watching isn't
the absolute best talk in this slot? Through no fault of the speaker I have tuned out or even ducked
out of talks part way through instead of giving the talk my full attention.
I get way more out of talks when I pay attention to them, and single track
conferences help me pay attention.

Single track conferences create shared experiences. The entire conference is in
it together. All the attendees see the same talks, which means they can chat
about the same talks in the hallway track. Speakers don't have to worry about
competing with other speakers for an audience. Attendees see talks they might
not have chosen themselves. Sometimes the things you don't know you are
interested in are the most interesting.


## Do Good

If you attend tech conferences, chances are you have enough black t-shirts
already. We love our swag (shout out to [Gary
Wilkerson](https://twitter.com/wilkerson_gary) for designing such great stuff)
and are excited to give it to people, but some people are just tired of t-shirts and
stickers and socks and patches and all that stuff. That is why we added the option this year
to donate swag to charity.

This means we take the money we would have spent ordering swag and instead
donate it to [Girl Develop It](https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/provo). We
also allowed attendees to donate to GDI by paying a bit more for their tickets,
and we donated a portion of the proceeds from every ticket sale to GDI. In total, we ended up donating
$4,551.15.

## Everything Should Be Chill

This isn't really a specific thing we did, but more of an overarching
philosophy. I'd like people to describe React Rally as "chill". That comes out
through the conference size (we had about 420 attendees, and that feels like
a chill number), the activities (food trucks, a party in a part with lawn games
and some live acoustic guitar, another party playing board games and drinking
milk shakes), bringing my daughter on stage, having music playing during breaks,
and a bunch of other little things. Life is stressful. Conferences should be
chill.

## We Still Made Mistakes

We made *so many* mistakes this year.

* The A/V was absolutely not at the level we
wanted (which goes against **Treat Speakers Well**, so it hurts even more). Matt
had to perform some behind-the-scenes heroics to prevent it from being worse
than it was. He is amazing, but the A/V was not.

* The lines for the breakfast food trucks were too long. We had to push back the
start time of the conference to make sure everyone got a chance to eat.

* We didn't advertise the ability to donate your swag or just donate directly to
GDI enough, so many people didn't know they had that option.


There are a bunch more things on our list to improve next year, but despite
these mistakes, I'd still call React Rally 2016 a success. We heard nice things
from both attendees and speakers. It turns out that people will
forgive lots of mistakes if they feel like your heart is in the right place.


## Steal Every Good Idea

Almost every good idea we have is not original to us, but is taken from another
source.

The idea to use food trucks came from a 2015 sponsor. The
venue we used in 2015 and 2016 came from Mountain West Ruby Conf, and the idea
that we could even consider putting on a conference came when [Mike
Moore](https://twitter.com/blowmage)
asked us to help out with his conference. [Joe
Eames](https://twitter.com/josepheames) was an invaluable advisor in 2015 and
put us in contact with Sunny and [Zero Slope
Events](https://zeroslopeevents.com/), an amazing team  who does so much
behind-the-scenes work to make a conference run smoothly. [Leah
Silber](https://twitter.com/wifelette) wrote a great book called [Event
Driven](https://leanpub.com/eventdriven)
that set a standard for responsible and organized event planning that I'm
still trying to live up to. Matt and I were inspired by too many conferences and
people to list, but the idea of break time and downtime as a focus I believe
came from [JSConf](http://jsconf.com/).

There are too many people who have helped in other ways for my brain to ever
keep track of. The main point is that we have been inspired by many, helped
by many, and if React Rally is anything good at all it is due to the hard work
of many, many people. Speakers, attendees, event staff, friends and family have
all given something to make React Rally great. Thank you all so much.

See you in 2017.
