One output of experience is an ever-increasing list of things that caused you
pain in the past. Because you are not a monster, you want to save other people
pain. When you see them doing things that caused you pain, you warn them.

These warning can come in several forms - don't use this specific library, stay
away from this tool, this programming language is slow, this pattern is for
architecture astronauts, the entire paradigm of [current popular thing] is
fundamentally flawed.

The final form of this evolution is the cynicism crustacean ensconced within a
shell made of the disasters you have seen. This feels powerful. It can be fun
to be the wise elder telling legends of the great monster you barely escaped in
your younger days (find a video clip from Jaws, or someone female? Maybe a
Miyazaki film)

It also means that your experience is validated - if you hated a thing and it
sucks you were *RIGHT* to hate it. If you hated a thing and the problem was
*you*, you face the cold reality that maybe you did something wrong last time
around.  Most of us cannot bear to gaze into the abyss that yawns behind that
thought, so we trust our experience, we dogmaticize it, we turn our pain and
the bleached bones of dead projects to "best practices", and in turn, we
ourselves ossify.

New ideas or new technologies remind us of old pain and bounce off the
carapace of built-up wisdom. Eventually we are so encumbered by experience that
we become brittle and immobilized and changes in technology or culture or
management crumble us to dust.

## PUPPY BREAK

If you don't share experience with others, your effectiveness will never scale
beyond your own efforts. If you impart your battle scars on others without
considering the circumstances they were inflicted in, you will cause those who
believe you to miss out on awesome things. The challenge of the experienced
developer is to pass on wisdom without passing on dogma.



They become weighty, carved from stone and carried down from the mountain so
they must be from god.

Destination at the end of this path is

Type one vs type two errors - the cost of falsely identifying something as
painful or wrong when it isn't is hard to measure. The

Experience is a good thing. Software development without experience without
wisdom is kkkkkk
