title: A Short List of Software Writing That Circulates In My Brain
description: ""
published: true

A handful  of pieces of software writing float around in my brain. They rotate over time, loosely influenced by what I’m reading and what I’m working on. A current list is:
- [Programming As Theory Building](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf)
- [Being Glue](https://www.noidea.dog/glue)
- [Choose Boring Technology](https://boringtechnology.club/)
- [The Rise of Worse Is Better](https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html)

They are generally more strategic than tactical, which helps them age well. 

I wonder what the list will be in a year?
