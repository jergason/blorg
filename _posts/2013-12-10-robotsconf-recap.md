Take 200 web developers, dozens of robotics and electronics experts, copious
amounts of supplies and two days of open hack time. Mix in a blender, serve in
a glass with a little palm tree garnish thingy, and you have
[RobotsConf](http://robotsconf.com/). Here are some of my personal highlights.

## How is printer formed
Confession time: I used to think 3d printers were lame. Why would I pay many
thousands of dollars in order to fill my house with cheap plastic knicknacks?
Well THE JOKE IS ON ME because 3d printers are incredibly useful for actually
building things. Do you have an idea that needs some kind of gear, or case, or
lever, or anything besides a bunch of wires soldered together? Print them up
in minutes and you can prototype incredibly rapidly. Thanks to
[@suziam](https://twitter.com/suziam) and many others who helped noobs like me
print things.

## People are awesome

One of the things I love most about nerds is how excited we get about things
we think are cool. That excitement plus a common goal of MAKING ROBOTS
translated into a very friendly, welcoming environment. It was easy to wander up
and talk to people. The speaker`->`workshop format also helped break down the
weird "developer-celebrity" barriers that sometimes arise at conferences.

The friendly, welcoming environment was also enhanced by the diversity of the
speakers and attendees.

Very happy about that!!!</p>&mdash; RobotsConf (@RobotsConf) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobotsConf/statuses/408980441228533761">December 6, 2013</a></blockquote>

RobotsConf was also very friendly to beginners. My wife with me, and she
commented several times on how cool it was to see so many women speakers and
participants. The end result was a plan (her own idea) for us to go home and
build a network-connected Christmas ornament that lights up and sings on
demand. Congratulations RobotsConf, you have created another maker.

## Make art, bring people together

The end of the conference featured a few "big idea" talks, and two of them
especially stuck with me.

[@whichlight](https://twitter.com/whichlight) spoke on using technology to
[create public art](http://whichlight.github.io/robotsconf-talk/#/). The talk
matched the art he described in it, which was whimsical and playful while also
encouraging public participation. It was a beautiful reminder of the power
of creating things for fun.

Marc Goodner talked about starting a makerspace at
Microsoft, and how it grew from humble, scrappy beginnings to a large
community.

Together these two talks encouraged me to go home and *make* things: community,
relationships, and robots. A fitting end to a great conference.
