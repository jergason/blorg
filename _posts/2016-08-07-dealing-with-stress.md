title: Dealing With Stress
description: ""

I am a grown adult human being, and I've only recently realized that I have no
idea how to deal productively with stress. What I do have is an exceptional
ability to get stressed out by **literally anything**. This usually translates
into a constant feeling of being one missed email or bungled TODO away from
catastrophe. This is no way to live.

Luckily, I know smart and nice people on the internet. When I asked them, they
responded with great ideas.



The responses differed wildly, but fell in to a few main categories.

### Go Outside

Several people also mentioned [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), which
looks like a guided meditation app. Because I am a software developer, I am
attracted to the shiny idea that the solution to my problems is only an app away.
I'm definitely going to try this.

Many of you have thought deeply about how to manage stress and have figured out
ways to cope productively and healthily with it. The specifics differ from person
to person (sorry Aaron, probably not going fishing üêü), but the
broad similarities are encouraging. I'm going to get better at this (<sub>famous <sub>last <sub>words</sub></sub></sub>), and I'm
glad I have your examples to learn from.
